- Anthony Garcia-Cortes
- I used Windows 11 for this assignment

### Approach to writing my code
- My approach to writing this code was to break down the problem into a variety of challenges.
  - Refactoring my code to support the necessary structures for this sort of problem
  - Searching for the square with the king and start iterating through moves to see if the king can be captured
  - Adding extra code for handling moving the king
  - Adding extra code for handling castling
  - Adding in checks for checkmates and stalemates

- My biggest problems from this assignment just came from having to refactor a lot of my code since a lot of it wasn't really built for this kind of problem and so I had to make a lot of changes.
