# Add UCI Networking to your Chess engine

- Anthony Garcia-Cortes
- I used Windows 11 for this assignment
- I used CoreChess(Arena did not work for me) for this assignment

### Approach to writing my code
- My approach to try to just follow the Canvas and provided files as much as I could, and after doing so, and modifying the code a bit to match what I used, it worked fine in CoreChess! I couldn't get it to work on Arena, but maybe I just set it up wrong.
- There are still bugs that need to be fixed, but those can be handled later upon revisiting this project in the future!
